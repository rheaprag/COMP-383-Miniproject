# COMP 383 Miniproject

This is my code for the miniproject.

When implementing this code, replace the `path` with your own. 

In order to implement the code, you need to install and implement SRA toolkit, SPAdes, and Prokka. 

More information about SRA toolkit for this project can be found [here](https://trace.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Traces/sra/sra.cgi?view=toolkit_doc).

The system fetched the Illumina needs from [here](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sra/SRX5005282).
